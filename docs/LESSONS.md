# LESSONS — cross-session knowledge base

Hard-won fixes and gotchas pooled from every video build in this workspace. **Read
this before building** (it's faster than rediscovering a render bug), and **append to
it** whenever you hit-and-fix something new. This is how the studio gets more
efficient over time instead of relearning the same lessons.

> Format: each entry is **Symptom → Fix** with where it bites. Keep it terse.

## Render-breaking (these waste the most time)

- **GSAP from a CDN freezes the render / timeline never registers.** The render env's
  cert handling intermittently fails on `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, so `gsap.min.js` never
  loads and nothing animates (or the frame freezes). **Fix:** vendor GSAP locally and
  reference `assets/vendor/gsap.min.js`. The generator (`npm run new`) now does this
  automatically. Never use a CDN `<script>` for GSAP. *(Hit independently by multiple
  sessions.)*
- **Any render-time network fetch is non-deterministic and can fail.** Vendor
  everything — GSAP, fonts (local `.woff2`), images. No CDN scripts, no Google-Fonts
  `<link>` at render time. (Render contract rule 11.)

## Animation & visibility

- **`gsap.from()` on an element that starts at `opacity:0` leaves it invisible.** `from`
  computes the end state from the *current* (hidden) state. **Fix:** use
  `gsap.fromTo(el, {opacity:0, y:20}, {opacity:1, y:0})` for anything that begins hidden.
- **Lint warning `gsap_studio_edit_blocked` is benign** (appears in hyperframes ≥0.6.97
  for every registered timeline). It only means Studio can't drag-edit GSAP-controlled
  elements — which is correct for code-authored compositions. Survivable; don't contort
  the comp to silence it.

## Layout

- **Logo drifts / won't stay top-left.** The render engine repositions elements marked
  `class="clip"`. **Fix:** wrap the logo in a *positioned, non-`clip`* `<div>` and place
  the logo inside it.
- **Never animate `width/height/top/left` on a `<video>`** — the browser freezes the
  frame. Wrap it in a `<div>` and animate the wrapper. (Render contract rule 9.)

## Footage & A/V sync

- **Talking-head lips out of sync.** Source recordings often have a ~0.2s audio start
  offset that the engine drops. **Fix:** advance the video ~0.16s relative to audio so
  lips match (tune per clip).
- **Phone / vertical b-roll imports rotated.** **Fix:** rotate 90° CW during prep
  (`ffmpeg -vf "transpose=1"`). *Caveat:* if the file carries a rotation **display
  matrix** (e.g. iPhone selfie stored 1920×1080 + `rotation=-90`), ffmpeg **autorotates
  on decode by default** — a plain `scale=1080:1920,pad` already yields an upright
  portrait frame. Adding `transpose` on top double-rotates it. Check
  `ffprobe … -show_entries stream_side_data=rotation` before deciding.
- **Offline transcriber can't run (model download egress-blocked).** Some environments
  block the Whisper model download. **Fix:** caption from the known script text and
  anchor timing via silence analysis instead of word-level timestamps.

## Editing technique (talking-head cutdowns)

- **Hide every splice under a graphic, and cut on silence.** Silence-aligned cuts +
  placing motion-graphic overlays over the join make cutdowns feel seamless.
- **Footage-forward UGC with NO overlays: mask splices with a 0.15s `xfade` dissolve.**
  When the brief bans captions/graphics, a short cross-dissolve (baked in ffmpeg:
  `xfade=transition=fade:duration=0.15:offset=<cum-dur-0.15>` + `acrossfade=d=0.15`)
  hides both the jump-cut head-pop *and* the background change from a walking selfie —
  reads as a clean transition, not a hard cut, and honors the "no hard cuts" rule
  without any on-screen element. Cut on word boundaries / silence so the audio
  crossfade doesn't clip a consonant.
- **Multi-take reads rarely share a script.** Three "takes" of the same ad were three
  different wordings — only one contained the exact target lines. Transcribe **every**
  take (`hyperframes transcribe … --json`) and diff against the target script before
  picking; don't assume take N is take 1 re-read.

## Delivery & resolution

- **There is no 4:5 render "preset."** Ship the final via `--quality high` at the
  project's native size (e.g. 1080×1350). For Meta hi-res deliverables, also export 2×
  (2160×2700).
- **Preview localhost (3002) is unreachable from the browser on the web.** Use the
  render → frame-grab → `Read` loop instead. Live Studio works only on a local clone.

## AI b-roll model picks (mid-2026)

- **Default: Kling 3.0** for short social b-roll / animating product stills (~$0.10/sec,
  top realism-per-dollar). **Hero shots: Veo 3.1** (4K + native audio, ~$0.15/sec).
  **Budget/volume: Seedance 2.** Avoid Sora 2 (API deprecating Sept 2026).
- **Runway's API is a multi-model gateway** — one `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET` reaches
  `kling3.0_pro`, `veo3.1`, `seedance2`, `gen4.5`, etc. via `npm run gen --model <id>`.
  Keep Runway as the single integration; pick the model per shot.

## Environment

- **`hyperframes doctor` can false-negative on FFmpeg.** It reported `FFmpeg — Failed to
  run "/usr/bin/ffmpeg" -version` while `/usr/bin/ffmpeg -version` (and every real
  encode) worked fine. Don't abandon an ffmpeg step over that one check — verify by
  running ffmpeg directly. (`ffprobe` passed in the same doctor run.)

## Housekeeping

- **Gitignore render scratch dirs** (`render-work-*`, `**/renders/frames*`). They bloat
  commits and aren't deliverables.
